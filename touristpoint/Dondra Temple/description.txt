Historical Upulvan Maha Devalaya<br>

Devinuwara devalaya is a famous adorable place among visitors to Sri Lanka. The shrine is dedicated to the God Vishnu who is said to be the guardian god of Buddhism. According to the legend, god Upulvan transfigured himself as a kihiri log and floated into the sea beach of the Devinuwara kingdom. On the night prior to the incident King Dappula II (AD 660-665) who was the reigning monarch of Devundara was informed in a dream of the arrival god Upuvan in the form of a kihiri log. Then the kihiri log was carved as the god's figure and and thereafter brought it ceremonially to the Devale for enshrinement. From that, devotees draw from around the country throughout the year, especially during the Esala Poya Period.
